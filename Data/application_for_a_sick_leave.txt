Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and will not be able to come to work for the next few days. I woke up this morning with a high fever and severe body aches, and after consulting with my doctor, it was determined that I need to take some time off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to make up for the lost time upon my return. I will keep you updated on my progress and will let you know as soon as I am able to come back to work.

In the meantime, if there is anything urgent that needs to be addressed, please feel free to reach out to [Name of a coworker who can cover for you]. I have informed them of the situation and they are prepared to assist in my absence.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
