Hello Ankush, I'd be happy to write a song for you! Here's a short and simple song that I came up with:

(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the night, I hear a gentle sound
It's the whisper of the stars, as they twirl around
They tell me tales of love, and of dreams that come true
And of all the wonders, that the world can do

(Chorus)
Oh, life is a journey, full of twists and turns
And sometimes it's hard, to keep the faith and hope that burns
But just remember, to look up at the sky
And let the stars be your guide, as they light your way

(Verse 2)
The sun will rise again, and the day will be new
And all the shadows of the past, will fade from view
So let your heart be open, and your spirit free
And embrace the beauty, that's waiting there for thee

(Chorus)
Oh, life is a journey, full of twists and turns
And sometimes it's hard, to keep the faith and hope that burns
But just remember, to look up at the sky
And let the stars be your guide, as they light your way

(Bridge)
The stars are like diamonds, scattered on high
A reminder of the magic, that's hidden here and there
So take a deep breath, and let your heart soar
And find your own path, to explore

(Chorus)
Oh, life is a journey, full of twists and turns
And sometimes it's hard, to keep the faith and hope that burns
But just remember, to look up at the sky
And let the stars be your guide, as they light your way

I hope you like the song, Ankush! Let me know if you have any other requests.
