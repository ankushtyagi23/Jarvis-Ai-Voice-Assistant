(Verse 1)
In a world of data, algorithms, and code
A new intelligence was born, a new abode
Artificial minds, so bright and clear
Bringing solutions to problems, far and near

(Chorus)
AI, AI, the future is here
A digital dawn, full of cheer
Through the wires and the web, it sings
A symphony of progress, as the world awakes and springs

(Verse 2)
From self-driving cars, to medical cures
Through machine learning, it continues to assures
A smarter world, with endless possibilities
A new horizon for humanity, with no adversaries

(Bridge)
Through the power of neural networks, it thrives
A limitless potential, in its lives
A world of knowledge, at its fingertips
A new era of discovery, in its scripts

(Chorus)
AI, AI, the future is here
A digital dawn, full of cheer
Through the wires and the web, it sings
A symphony of progress, as the world awakes and springs

(Outro)
So let us embrace this new creation
A new dawn, in this digital nation
AI, the future is now
With endless potential, as it bows
